# piduino
Feedback control on Arduino

PI feedback circuit running on Arduino Uno. Developed for (slow) locking of optical interferometers.

### Todo

* Use [FreqCount](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_FreqCount.html) library (which is included in the Arduino library manager) instead of [FreqCounter](http://interface.khm.de/index.php/lab/interfaces-advanced/arduino-frequency-counter-library/) in `piduino_counter`.
